# Machine Learning with Python

Welcome to my Machine Learning with Python repository! 🚀

This repository contains my learning journey in machine learning, where I explore various algorithms and techniques using Python. The content is structured into two main categories: **Supervised Learning** and **Unsupervised Learning**.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 1. Supervised Learning
This folder contains machine learning techniques where the model learns from labeled data. It includes two major subcategories:
- **Regression** 📈: Predicting continuous values.
- **Classification** 🔍: Categorizing data into discrete classes.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
This folder includes machine learning methods that find patterns in data without labeled outputs.

## 🔥 Learning Topics
### 📂 Supervised Learning
#### Regression
Regression techniques are used for predicting continuous numerical values. Some topics covered include:
- **Simple Linear Regression**: Understanding and implementing the fundamental regression technique.

#### Classification
Classification techniques are used to categorize data into predefined groups.
