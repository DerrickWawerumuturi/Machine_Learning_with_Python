Unsupervised learning involves training models without labeled outputs, aiming to find hidden structures and patterns in data. Topics covered include:

- **Clustering** 🔄: Grouping similar data points together.
    - **K-Means Clustering**: A popular algorithm that partitions data into K clusters.
    - **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds a tree-based hierarchy of clusters.
    - **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)**: A clustering method that works well with noise and varying density.

- **Dimensionality Reduction** 📉: Techniques used to reduce the number of features while preserving essential patterns.
    - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Extracting the most important components in data.
    - **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**: Used for high-dimensional data visualization.
    - **Autoencoders**: Neural networks used to compress and reconstruct data efficiently.

- **Anomaly Detection** ⚠️: Identifying unusual patterns or outliers in datasets.
    - **Isolation Forest**: A tree-based approach that detects anomalies effectively.
    - **One-Class SVM**: A variation of SVM designed for anomaly detection.
    - **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**: A density-based method for outlier detection.
