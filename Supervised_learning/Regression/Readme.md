#### Regression
Regression techniques are used for predicting continuous numerical values. Some topics covered include:

- **Understanding Regression Models**: Learning how different regression models work and when to use them.
- **Feature Selection and Engineering**: Improving regression models by selecting the most relevant input variables.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters to improve performance.
- **Evaluating Regression Models**:
    - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
    - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
    - **R-squared Score (RÂ²)**
- **Applying Regression in Real-World Problems**: Examples like house price prediction, sales forecasting, and stock market trends.
