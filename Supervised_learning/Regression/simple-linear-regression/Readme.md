## ðŸ“‚ Simple Linear Regression
This section covers:

- **Introduction to Simple Linear Regression**: Understanding the relationship between a single independent variable and a dependent variable.
- **Mathematical Formula**:
    - The equation of a simple linear regression model:
      \[ y = mx + b \]
    - Where:
        - \( y \) is the predicted output.
        - \( x \) is the input feature.
        - \( m \) is the slope (coefficient).
        - \( b \) is the intercept.
- **Implementing Simple Linear Regression in Python**:
    - Using **NumPy** for manual calculations.
    - Using **Scikit-Learn** for quick model building.
- **Visualizing Regression Results**:
    - Plotting regression lines using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- **Evaluating Model Performance**:
    - Calculating Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared value.
- **Use Cases of Simple Linear Regression**:
    - Predicting house prices based on square footage.
    - Estimating sales revenue based on advertising spend.
