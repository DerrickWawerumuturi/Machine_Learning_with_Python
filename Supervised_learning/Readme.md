### 1. Supervised Learning
This folder contains machine learning techniques where the model learns from labeled data, meaning that each input has a corresponding known output. It includes two major subcategories:

- **Regression** üìà: Predicting continuous values using various models such as:
    - **Simple Linear Regression**: A straightforward approach using a single independent variable.
    - **Multiple Linear Regression**: Extends simple regression by using multiple predictors.
    - **Polynomial Regression**: Capturing non-linear relationships between variables.
    - **Ridge and Lasso Regression**: Techniques to handle multicollinearity and overfitting by applying regularization.
    - **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: A powerful method that extends SVM concepts to regression tasks.

- **Classification** üîç: Categorizing data into discrete classes using methods such as:
    - **Logistic Regression**: A statistical model for binary classification.
    - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple yet effective algorithm for classification tasks.
    - **Decision Trees and Random Forests**: Tree-based models that work well for both classification and regression.
    - **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**: A robust classifier that uses hyperplanes for decision boundaries.
    - **Neural Networks**: Implementing deep learning models for more complex classification problems.
    - **Naive Bayes Classifier**: A probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem, often used in text classification.
